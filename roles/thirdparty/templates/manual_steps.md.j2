# Manual Steps

The following items could not be automated by the playbook and require manual intervention.

## Third-Party Software

{% for item in thirdparty_manual %}
### {{ item.name }}
{{ item.description }}
{% if item.source is defined and item.source %}
- **Source:** {{ item.source }}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

## Always Manual

These items always require manual setup regardless of the source system:

### SSH Keys
Copy your SSH keys from a secure backup to `~/.ssh/` and set correct permissions:
```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_*
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_*.pub
```

### Browser Profiles
Sign in to your browsers to sync bookmarks, extensions, and settings:
- Firefox: Sign in to Firefox Sync
- Brave/Chrome: Sign in to Google account

### Bluetooth Devices
All Bluetooth devices need to be re-paired on the new machine.

### Application Logins
Re-authenticate in applications that store credentials locally:
- Email clients
- Chat apps (Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Cloud storage (Dropbox, Nextcloud, etc.)
- IDE accounts and licenses

### API Tokens & Credentials
Regenerate or re-enter API tokens, access keys, and credentials stored in:
- `~/.config/` application configs
- Environment variables in shell config
- `.env` files in project directories

### GNOME Keyring / KDE Wallet
Secrets stored in the keyring/wallet are not migrated. You'll need to re-enter
passwords for applications that use the system credential store.
